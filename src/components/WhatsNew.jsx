        desc: 'The Railway server was generating 60-100+ log lines/second, overwhelming the log pipeline and dropping 115,000 messages in 30 minutes. Root cause: six hot-path loggers (RBN spots, callsign lookups, WSPR heatmap, PSK-MQTT SSE connects) were writing directly to console on every request instead of going through the log level system. All moved behind logDebug/logInfo/logErrorOnce. Added a global token-bucket rate limiter (burst 20, refill 10/sec) as a safety net — excess logs are silently dropped with a 60-second summary.',

If a source returns 429/403 it immediately tries the next. Cache extended from 6 to 12 hours, with stale data served up to 48 hours while retrying. 30-minute negative cache prevents hammering when all sources are down.

On a 2560px ultrawide, sidebars grow to ~460px + 500px (was capped at 320 + 340px), using the extra space instead of giving the map an absurdly wide center column. Panel height caps removed so DXpeditions, POTA, and Contests panels flex to fill available space.',

IDs are now content-based (time + freq + message). QSO logging checks for duplicate call + frequency + mode within 60 seconds. PSK Reporter MQTT spot ingestion now deduplicates by sender + receiver + band + frequency before buffering. Client-side merge in both hooks uses content-based matching as a final safety net.',

Root cause: document-level mousemove/mouseup listeners were never cleaned up on layout change, so stale handlers fired during the next drag and teleported the panel off-screen.

The listener now asserts DTR HIGH after opening the port with a 300ms stabilisation delay and hupcl:false to prevent DTR drop on reconnect. (2) Windows systems with Node.js pre-installed would fail to find npm during the bat-file setup because the system Node path wasn't being resolved correctly — fixed with \u2018where node\u2019 / \u2018where npm\u2019 full-path resolution.",

Previously, the operating prefix was being stripped and the home callsign's country was used instead. A new extractOperatingPrefix() function identifies which part of a compound callsign carries the DXCC information and uses that for location lookups, while still using the base callsign for QRZ lookups.",
